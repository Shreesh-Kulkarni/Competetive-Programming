This problem is a programming version of Problem 239 from projecteuler.net

A set of disks numbered 1 through n are placed in a line in random order.
What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that exactly k prime number discs are found away from their natural positions? 
(Any number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their natural positions.)
It can be shown that for a given constraints the answer can be represented as a/b , where a and b are coprime positive integers and b≢0(mod 10⁹+123) .
Print the value of a.b⁻¹ modulo 10⁹+123 .

Input Format
The only line of input contains two integers n and k  separated by single space.
